    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>
        HTML stands for <strong>Hypertext Markup Language!</strong> The mdn docs state that it's 
        "the most basic building block of the Web." It's also commonly referred to as the skeleton of
        a website.

        To understand the purpose of HTML, you need to understand the basics of how a website works. There
        are three main components to most websites: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML allows you to display content
        on a webpage. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to define how you want to content to appear. JavaScript 
        provides functionality to the page (it allows you to manipulate, add to, takeaway, and much more). HTML is
        the starting point for most web developers, so that's where we are going to start. Let's get to it!
